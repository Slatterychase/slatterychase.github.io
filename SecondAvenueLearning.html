                            <h3 style="font-weight: bold"> (C#, Nintendo SDK, Unity, Javascript) - Spring 2019 </h3>
                            <p> During my time at Second Avenue Learning, the majority of my time was spent working on the port of the Original Mobile Games to the Nintendo Switch, but also assisted in several other projects within the company, including updating the mobile version of the Original Mobile Games, developing an open source web application, as well as assisting in QA between projects.</p>
                            <p>
                                My work in this role involved: 
                            </p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                  Porting a mobile Unity game to the Nintendo Switch using the Nintendo SDK through updating existing features and gameplay mechanics to feel better for the player, update and expand the User Interface, adding new features and mechanics, and getting the project ready for release.
                                </li>
                                  <li>
                                  Fixing issues with a Unity mobile game to provide additional gameplay features, fixed bugs that had been reported, and providing quality of life updates to make it match the Nintendo Switch version.
                                </li>
                                  <li>
                                  Developing an open source web application with to assist with teaching sign language. This site involved the ability for users to create stories by giving a list of words, definitions, a video of the story being signed, and time stamps for key words, which then were used to create the story pages, which served the videos, as well as generated the sentences of the story, with clickable terms that provided a definition along with a video clip of the sign being performed. Developed two web games that took in the word list, videos and definitions and created games based on these variables.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Between projects I assisted the QA Lead in providing QA for a web application to ensure it worked across browsers, as well as to find niche bugs and provide thorough documentation for the developers to find and fix bugs.
                                </li>
                                
                            </ul>
